# Privacy policy
> Last updated June 25, 2019

## A small letter from the creators of DontBugMe
DontBugMe was created to improve your privacy online - not limit it. This is why we dispense with using analytics in our extension and do not sell your personal data to anyone.

We do however need to send your current website to BugMeNot to get credentials availible for this domain. As we do still want you to have the greatest privacy possible, we only send the TLD of your current website, e.g. `"example.com"` instead of `"example.com/profiles/John.Doe"`.

## Introducing the Privacy Policy

This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explains how DontBugMe ("DontBugMe", "browser extension" or "we") collects and uses information from users of the browser extension.

This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which we will process information we collect from you, or that you provide to us, in connection with your use of the DontBugMe extension, regardless of how you access or use them. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand your rights in relation to how we use and process information that you share and that we collect.

The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to provide our service which will result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.

## About us
The party responsible for DontBugMe (the "controller") for purposes of data protection law is:

```
Bennett Hollstein
Burgweg 8
79112 Freiburg
Germany
```


## Information our browser extension collects

Our browser extension collects your current TLD ("Top-Level-Domain", e.g. "example.com") when you
- open the browser popup, e.g. by clicking on the "DontBugMe" icon in your browser toolbar
- enable "Automatically check for availible accounts and show badge". In this case, DontBugMe will collect your current TLD every time you open a new website or switch browser tabs or windows.

Your data processed when using our extension will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.

## Information we do not collect

We only collect the TLD of your current tab or window. This means we do not collect any data on e.g. your search history, your emails, your credit card information or other information about your browser.

## How we store your information

We do not store the information our browser extension collects in any way ourselves.

## How we share your information with third parties

Our browser extension will share your current TLD with `BugMeNot.com` in order to get a list of availible accounts. In order for this to happen, your browser will send a request to `http://bugmenot.com/view/[TLD]`, replacing `[TLD]` with your current TLD, e.g. `example.com`.

DontBugMe will share your TLD with `BugMeNot.com` in the following events:
- You open the browser popup, e.g. by clicking on the "DontBugMe" icon in your browser toolbar
- You enable "Automatically check for availible accounts and show badge". In this case, DontBugMe will send your current TLD to `BugMeNot.com` when you open a new website or switch browser tabs or windows. The extension will then cache the result it got back from `BugMeNot.com` for a limited time in order to not send a new request everytime you open the same TLD.

For more information on how `BugMeNot.com` will process your data, please visit [its terms of service](http://bugmenot.com/terms.php).

## Children

We created DontBugMe for the exclusive use of adults aged 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under the age of 18; if you are a child under 18, please do not attempt to use DontBugMe or send any personal information about yourself to us. As we do not collect any information about our users, you will not need to contact us about the removal of any of your data.

## Changes

We will continue to update our policies and practices as needed. As such, our Privacy Policy will be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting any changes here.
